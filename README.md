# First PROJECT - Light Book

## Project Brief

A Modular Programming Prototyping Kit that could help users to interact and learn about p5.js. 
The Light Book is an interactive lighting experience that responds to the book's state, featuring a wake-up animation when opened, a dynamic swimming effect for prolonged reading, and a calming breathing glow when closed, creating an immersive and intuitive ambient light interaction.
